# MidiParser
A MIDI parser library.

## Using in your own projects:
- You can see an example in the Example/ folder. You may need to change the
 path of the MIDI file in Main.cpp depending on your build system.
 This was written in Visual Studio 2019, but it should be cross platform.
- Link with the library
- Include MidiParser.h

## MIDI files used:
- mapleleaf7.mid: http://www.keeper1st.com/music/mapleleaf7.mid
